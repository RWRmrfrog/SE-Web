                <h2 class="heading">Welcome to the SwordsEdge Website!</h2>
                <p>This is the members only website, where you can download world backups as well as the resource pack we use on the server! Currently, this is a bare-bones website, but more is planned to come soon.</p>

                <h4><strong>5/9/24</strong></h4>
                <p>It's been quite busy for the backend of SwordsEdge these past 5 months. I apologize for many delays but the server has been in the procss of moving from a linux based system to a windows system. The transition has been rough but things are getting a lot more organized, maybe even more than they originally where! Stay patient, as the server and this website have many more updates and polishes to go. Also big thanks to <a href="jashduck/JashDuck.html" id="JashDuck">JashDuck</a> for the help with the website backend once again!</p>
                <h4><strong>10/8/23</strong></h4>
                <p>The SwordsEdge Website has been updated! Everything has been streamlined and we have a brand new layout! I know the website has been down for a while now, so I'd like to thank you for your patience.</p>
                <h4><strong>4/1/23</strong></h4>
                <p>After 3 long years of keeping up SwordsEdge, I regret to inform you all that I will be stepping down from being the server owner. I know this might be shocking to many of you, but I hope you understand. Though SwordsEdge will continue under a new admin, I will still be here to answer any questions you have. Speaking of the new admin, I'd like to introduce the new owner of the server- Cozz! Anyway, thats it from me, I hope you have a fantastic April Fools day!</p>
                <h4><strong>2/21/23</strong></h4>
                <p>Origins+ has been updated to 1.19.2! Head over to the Origins+ page to see how you can join!</p>
                <h4><strong>2/21/23</strong></h4>
                <p>The SwordsEdge website has been updated to accommodate different screen sizes! Mobile uses rejoice!</p>
